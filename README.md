# Transistion-from-SQL-to-No-SQL
Conversion of SQL database to NoSQL by denormalising the normalized table into a main table. 

Abstract

In this assignment, we have converted our SQL database to NoSQL. We do so by denormalizing the normalized table into a main table. We have chosen movies as our domain. We have converted the dataframe using NoSQL database MongoDB. 
The original database had 3 parts:
Movies
Users
Ratings

We have connected Python to MongooDB  and we have asked queries and tested use cases to get a specific outcome.
The queries are as follows:
What are tags are associated with a person, place or thing?
What social media users are like other social media users in your domain?
What people, places or things are popular in your domain?
What people, places or things are trending in your domain? (A trend is popularity over time)
